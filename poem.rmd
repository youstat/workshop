## First Verse 
<Put the first two verses of Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol in this section>
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"  
He took his vorpal sword in hand:  
  Long time the manxome foe he sought--  
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,  
  And stood awhile in thought.

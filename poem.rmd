## First Verse 
<Put the first two verses of Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol in this section>
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"  
He took his vorpal sword in hand:  
  Long time the manxome foe he sought--  
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,  
  And stood awhile in thought. 
  
## Second Verse
<Put the first two verses of The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost here>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

Then took the other, as just as fair,  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,  


## Third Verse
<Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here>
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make   
      The billows smooth and bright —   
And this was odd, because it was   
      The middle of the night.   

The moon was shining sulkily,   
      Because she thought the sun   
Had got no business to be there   
      After the day was done —   
"It's very rude of him," she said,   
      "To come and spoil the fun."
